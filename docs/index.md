Inspired in part by and some portions based on [PyABC](https://github.com/campagnola/pyabc) (`pyabc`; [MIT License](https://github.com/campagnola/pyabc/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)), hence "PyABC2" and the package name `pyabc2`. No relation to [this pyabc](https://github.com/icb-dcm/pyabc) that is on PyPI.
